# AI Powered Fitness Tracker

## Project Overview
This fitness tracker is a cutting-edge tool designed to improve exercise form and efficiency by using advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe, the tracker provides real-time feedback on the execution of exercises, starting with bicep curls. This project aims to assist users in enhancing their exercise routines by providing immediate, actionable feedback on their performance, ensuring exercises are performed correctly and safely.

## Features (i.e. How is this different and better than anything else?)
- **Real-Time Pose Estimation**: Tracks user movements by detecting joints and calculating angles using MediaPipe.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates the form and speed of exercises against a trained model to provide feedback.
- **User Feedback**: Displays accuracy and speed metrics immediately after each rep to help users improve their technique and also provides prompts to adjust their pace if a user is too slow or too fast.
- **Quantifying workout quality**: While other systems may give feedback on user form, this program offers quantitative feedback to users so they have a better idea of how to improve their form.
